# Linkedin Highlighter

The purpose of this extension is to highlight the job postings made by companies which have more than a 4.0 rating on Glassdoor. This is useful for job seekers who want to quickly identify companies with a good reputation.

Apart from the highlighting, the extension also provides the exact rating of the company in glassdoor, as well as the number of reviews that the rating is based on.
