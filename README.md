# Linkedin Highlighter

The purpose of this extension is to optimize job search on Linkedin by filtering job openings based on the glassdoor rating of their company. After filtering, the extension highlights the job postings of companies with a rating of 4.0 or higher in red, and the ones with a rating of more than 4.5 in green.

Apart from the filtering and highlighting, the extension also provides the exact rating of the company in glassdoor, as well as the number of reviews that the rating is based on.
